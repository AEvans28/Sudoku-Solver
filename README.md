# Sudoku-Solver
A programming assignment for CS 220 at UMass Amherst. This project was designed to challenge all students in the course on completing a new, and substantially more difficult, topic of steams.

Programmed using scala, compiled using BST and tested using the terminal, all within a virtual machine installed with Linux.
